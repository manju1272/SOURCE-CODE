Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats and unauthorized access. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, strategies, and practices designed to safeguard digital assets. With the increasing reliance on digital systems, cyber security has become a critical concern for individuals, businesses, and governments. One of the most important aspects of cyber security is encryption algorithms, which are used to protect sensitive data by converting it into unreadable formats. Encryption ensures that data remains confidential and secure during transmission and storage. Advanced Encryption Standard is one of the most widely used encryption algorithms, known for its efficiency and strong security. It operates on fixed-size blocks of data and uses symmetric key cryptography, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. RSA is another widely used encryption algorithm that relies on asymmetric cryptography, using a pair of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. It is commonly used in secure communications, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. The Playfair cipher is a classical encryption technique that uses a grid-based system to encode messages, making it difficult for unauthorized users to decipher without the correct key. Encryption algorithms play a fundamental role in ensuring data security in various applications, including online banking, secure communications, and digital transactions.
