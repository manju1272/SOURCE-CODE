Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger technology that enables secure and transparent record-keeping across a distributed network. Originally created for Bitcoin, blockchain has since expanded into finance, healthcare, supply chains, and more. Each transaction is stored in a "block" that is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chronological chain. Because these records are distributed across many nodes and secured by consensus mechanisms, they are extremely resistant to tampering and fraud. Public blockchains are open to anyone, while private blockchains limit access to certain participants.

Blockchain’s applications go far beyond cryptocurrency. In finance, it enables real-time, low-cost cross-border payments. In supply chains, it helps verify product origins and improve traceability. Smart contracts—self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain—automate complex workflows without intermediaries. Despite its potential, blockchain faces challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainty. Still, many industries view blockchain as a transformative force capable of building trust, transparency, and efficiency in digital ecosystems.
