Online banking has revolutionized how people access and manage their money. Through websites and mobile apps, customers can now check balances, transfer funds, and pay bills without visiting a branch. Financial institutions are leveraging digital platforms to offer services such as instant loans, digital wallets, and recurring bill payments. This digital shift has made banking more inclusive, particularly in remote areas where physical banks are scarce. Additionally, the growth of secure payment technologies such as UPI and contactless cards has led to a surge in non-cash transactions. However, with convenience comes riskâ€”cyberattacks and data breaches remain major concerns. To counter these threats, banks implement strict cybersecurity protocols like biometric logins and encrypted channels. As more people go online for financial services, the need for digital literacy and responsible financial behavior has become more important than ever.
