This cd was pretty relaxing.
I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
I would probably recommend it to a friend.

Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
Did you know the Pilgrim's wouldn't have been starving if they knew how to fish?!
I think he thinks we shouldn't over-fish for the sake of the fish- I think we need to not over-fish for our own sake.
I think it is wrong to kill an animal unless you need it.
What about killing animals that are getting in the way of your 'crops'?
Such as wolves after chickens?
I don't know.

Hi! Right now I am reading books about the craft of acting.
I am learning on my spare time at home about acting in general.
This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
So pick up and read this book.
You will be glad you did!

Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
During his time in Chechnya, the author seems to have grown quite affectionate toward the Chechens.
This leads to the Russians being painted as the villain (not that they are angels, but neither are the Chechens).
However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
This book is not for beginners, but few Yale publishings are.
Beginnners should look for a Chechnya book from a mass-market publisher.
