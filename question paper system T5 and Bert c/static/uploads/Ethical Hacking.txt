Ethical Hacking also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking is the practice of testing computer systems networks and applications to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them Ethical hackers use the same techniques tools and methodologies as cybercriminals but with legal authorization and the intent to strengthen cybersecurity organizations governments and businesses hire ethical hackers to conduct security assessments ensure compliance with security standards and protect sensitive data from cyber threats Ethical hacking plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by helping organizations identify weaknesses in their digital infrastructure implement security measures and prevent data breaches

Ethical hacking involves several key phases starting with reconnaissance where ethical hackers gather information about the target system using open-source intelligence OSINT and network scanning tools reconnaissance helps identify potential entry points and weaknesses in an organizationâ€™s network next comes scanning where ethical hackers use tools like Nmap and Wireshark to analyze network traffic detect vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of systems after scanning ethical hackers proceed to gaining access by exploiting vulnerabilities using penetration testing techniques such as SQL injection cross-site scripting XSS and buffer overflow attacks once access is gained ethical hackers attempt privilege escalation to assess the extent of potential damage a cybercriminal could cause maintaining access is another phase where ethical hackers determine if an attacker could create backdoors for persistent control finally ethical hackers document their findings provide recommendations for security improvements and help organizations patch vulnerabilities
