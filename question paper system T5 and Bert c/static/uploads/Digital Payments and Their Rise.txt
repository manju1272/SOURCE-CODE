Digital payments have become an essential part of modern financial systems, especially with the rise of mobile banking, online shopping, and contactless technology. Consumers today rely on mobile wallets, UPI apps, and internet banking to carry out transactions conveniently and securely. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this transition, as physical cash handling posed health concerns. Businesses, both small and large, have embraced digital payment platforms to streamline operations and reach a wider customer base. With QR codes, NFC payments, and peer-to-peer transfer options, money can be exchanged quickly without the need for traditional banks or cash registers. Governments have also promoted digital finance as part of their economic modernization efforts. Security, however, remains a critical factor, and efforts are continually made to protect users through encryption, two-factor authentication, and fraud monitoring tools.
